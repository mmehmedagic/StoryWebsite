    <h1>A Warm Shower</h1>
    <div id="story">
      <p>
        I woke up and yawmed my way out of bed.<br/>
        I brushed my teeth.<br/>
        I looked out the window.<br/>
        I saw that a meteorite shower started.<br/>
        I ran for my life out of my house in my sleep attire.<br/>
        I went into a bunker.<br/>
        I ate a breakfast of converse soup.<br/>
        I saw my family and friends miserable in the bunker.<br/>
        I fell asleep on the cold, hard floor.<br/><br/>
        I woke up again but not in my bed.<br/>
        It turned out to be a dream.<br/>
        I had fallen asleep in the shower.<br/>
        Oh, the irony!<br/>
        A nice, warm shower...<br/>
        I got ready for school after the incident.<br/>
        I went to school with the following schedule:<br/>
          Period 1: Precalculus<br/>
          Period 2: Health<br/>
          Period 3: Human Geography<br/>
          Period 4: English II<br/>
          Period 5: Spanish III<br/>
          Period 6: Lunch<br/>
          Period 7: Physics 1<br/>
          Period 8: Programming 1<br/>
        After school, I came home and decided to take a nap.<br/>
        And so, I dozed off... ZZZZZ<br/><br/>
        The dream from before continued in a heartbeat.<br/>
        It was horrifying in the bunker.<br/>
        NASA came and offered to launch us to Mars beacsue of the apocolypse.<br/>
        As the rocket was in the air, a meteor hit us.<br/><br/>
        I woke up once again with a fright.<br/>
        And the hot water was running from my brother showering.<br/>
        It was 8:01 AM the next day...
